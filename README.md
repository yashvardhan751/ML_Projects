Contains all machine learning models done by me.

1.Diabetes Prediction:I developed a diabetes prediction model using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which classifies whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on input features like glucose levels, BMI, age, etc. SVM was chosen for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and ability to find optimal separating hyperplanes. The model was trained on a dataset with labeled diabetes outcomes and achieved a high accuracy of around 77%, making it a reliable tool for early diabetes detection and prevention.

2.Spam_mail_prediction:I created a spam mail prediction model using Logistic Regression, which identifies whether an email is spam or not based on features like word frequencies, presence of specific keywords, etc. SVM was selected for its robustness in handling sparse data and ability to classify non-linear boundaries effectively. The model was trained on a labeled dataset of emails and achieved an accuracy of approximately 95%, demonstrating its efficacy in filtering out spam emails and improving inbox management.
